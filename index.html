                <p class="bio">I am a transformative web developer that brings passion and creativity to my craft. I love using code to solve complex problems. I love the logic behind coding. I love the feeling of accomplishment after spending hours trying to figure out a coding problem. I simply love the puzzle which coding is. Outside of the realm of coding, I am a chess enthusiast, born philosopher, avid reader and a community servant.</p>

                    Coding is not just a hobby or career for me, it is a gateway to finding the secrets of the world and who we are as humans. Creating intricate web pages that allow people to communicate with each other around the world, gathering data to understand more about the world we live in and the people that inhabit it, and obtaining snapshots of other people's culture and traditions will not only give us the power to coexist and collaborate, but with this harmonious spirit just a click away, software development gives us the power to uncover the truths about the world. I think it is with technology that we will solve the world problems. It is with technology where we as people will reach our fullest potential.
